# Beginner Guide

## Why
This beginner guide is to help developers new to iOS and/or Swift not fall into some really common pitfalls. This document is phrased as a list of "rules" to be A) cheeky and B) help with remembering.

* [Rule #0: Be Polite](#rule-0-be-polite)
* [Rule #1: Be Pure](#rule-1-be-pure)
* [Rule #2: Be Marxist](#rule-2-be-marxist)
* [Rule #3: Be Functional](#rule-3-be-functional)
* [Rule #4: Be Athiest](#rule-4-be-atheist)

# Rule #0: Be Polite
[< Top](#beginner-guide)  
Never force your code `!` - always ask `?` instead.

# Rule #1: Be Pure
[< Top](#beginner-guide)  
Avoid using `var`  
Never use the `mutating` keyword - why do you even know about this?

# Rule #2: Be Marxist
[< Top](#beginner-guide)  
Avoid race conditions and data errors by using `struct` and `enum` instead of `class`

# Rule #3: Be Functional
[< Top](#beginner-guide)  
Avoid side-effects in your code by using functional patterns

# Rule #4: Be Athiest
[< Top](#beginner-guide)  
Break God-Objects down into task-specific handlers
