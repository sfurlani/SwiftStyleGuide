# Beginner Guide

## Why
This beginner guide is to help developers new to iOS and/or Swift not fall into some really common pitfalls. This document is phrased as a list of "rules" to be A) cheeky and B) help with remembering.

# Rule #0 - "Don't Rape your Code" or "Never `!`"

# Rule #1 - "Mutants are the Enemy" or "Never `var`"

# Rule #2 - "Be a Communist" or "Avoid Objects"

# Rule #3 - "God is Dead" or "Break Objects Down"
